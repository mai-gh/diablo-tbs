### Starting a Game

Since you have a lot more control over timing in battles, the game becomes less difficult.

I recommend starting new games on Nightmare difficulty.

If playing a Sorcerer, it is possible to start at level 1.

If playing a Warrior or a Rogue, I recommend starting at level 9.

When starting a new game, press enter, type `givexp 8`, press enter.

Now spend the attribute points as you like. 

### Game Controls

This modification is intended to be play pn a pc, with mostly the keyboard, but the mouse or trackpad still being necessary for using menus and inventory

New controls:

 - h: move left
 - j: move down
 - k: move up
